#### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** and pull requests
2. **Create an issue** to discuss major changes
3. **Assign yourself** to the issue you're working on

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
- Write or update tests as needed
- Update documentation if necessary
- Ensure all tests pass

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Use conventional commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new APK signing feature"
git commit -m "fix: resolve build issue on Windows"
git commit -m "docs: update installation guide"
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 4. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub with:

- **Clear title** describing the change
- **Detailed description** of what was changed and why
- **Reference to related issues** (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- **Screenshots** for UI changes

### 5. Code Review Process

- Maintainers will review your PR
- Address any feedback or requested changes
- Once approved, your PR will be merged

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use **TypeScript** for new code
- Follow **ESLint** configuration
- Use **Prettier** for code formatting
- Prefer **async/await** over promises
- Use **meaningful variable names**

### Code Style

```typescript
// Good
async function buildApk(config: BuildConfig): Promise<BuildResult> {
  try {
    const result = await executeGradleBuild(config);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new BuildError(`Build failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
}

// Avoid
function buildApk(cfg) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // ... complex callback logic
  });
}
```

### File Organization

- **Group related functionality** in modules
- **Use clear file names** that describe their purpose
- **Keep files focused** on a single responsibility
- **Export interfaces** and types appropriately

### Error Handling

- Use **custom error classes** for different error types
- Provide **meaningful error messages**
- Include **context information** in errors
- Handle errors **gracefully** in the UI

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run web server tests
npm run test:web-server
```

### Writing Tests

- Write **unit tests** for new functions
- Add **integration tests** for new features
- Use **descriptive test names**
- Follow **AAA pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert)

```typescript
describe('buildApk', () => {
  it('should successfully build APK with valid configuration', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const config = createValidConfig();
    
    // Act
    const result = await buildApk(config);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.apkPath).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage

- Maintain **high test coverage** (aim for >80%)
- Focus on **critical paths** and **edge cases**
- Test **error conditions** as well as success paths

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use **JSDoc comments** for functions and classes
- Document **complex algorithms** or business logic
- Keep comments **up-to-date** with code changes

```typescript
/**
 * Builds an Android APK from the provided configuration
 * @param config - Build configuration including app details and options
 * @param options - Additional build options
 * @returns Promise resolving to build result with APK path
 * @throws BuildError when build process fails
 */
async function buildApk(config: BuildConfig, options?: BuildOptions): Promise<BuildResult> {
  // Implementation
}
```
